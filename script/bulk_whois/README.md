This script will perform whois IP lookup for a set of IP address from a text file where the file contains an IP address per line. The script also will perform Iris Investigate lookup for IPv4 address the registered domain was last known to point to during an active DNS check. Once all the information has been gathered, the script will write the result into a file with the following naming convention: <IP>_result.txt

Usage: <script> <input file>

Note: The script is just an example on how to perform bulk IP lookup. Your use of the code is at your own risk.
